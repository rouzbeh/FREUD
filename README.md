# FREUD (Witty backronym:  "Facilitating Research Experience at Union Digitally")
## New announcement
## Original announcement (found on http://www1.union.edu/bizerg/freudcode.html)
I am pleased to make available the source code for FREUD, Union College's in-house participant recruitment system.  Anyone is welcome to download, use, and modify the source code.  Some important information:

FREUD can:

* Allow administrators to post, edit, and delete experiments
* Allow experimenters to post, edit, and delete sessions
* Allow participants to register for and cancel sessions

FREUD cannot:

* Keep track of attendance at sessions

I cannot:

* Provide any support whatsoever. I helped our ITS department design the system, but I have no knowledge of how FREUD works. 
* Provide any guarantees as to how well the program will work.  It's been working fine here for several years, but your results may vary.  Computers are funny like that.

If you use the program, drop me a line (bizerg@union.edu) and let me know how it's working!
